			=================================
About:
-----
MadEdit is a cross-platform Text/Hex Editor written in C++ & wxWidgets.
MadEdit supports many useful functions, e.g. SyntaxHighlightings, WordWraps, 
Encodings, Column/Hex Modes, and a Plugin system(not work yet).
In HexMode, MadEdit can open large files which size is up to 32GB (INT_MAX*16).


Supported Platforms:
-------------------
A. Linux, FreeBSD, and Unix-like OS (__WXGTK__):
   a. GNU C++ 3.x/4.x:
      Required Libraries to compile:
      1. wxWidgets-2.6.1 or higher with Unicode enabled
      2. Boost-1.33.0 or higher
      3. Boost.Xpressive latest version

B. MS Windows (__WXMSW__):
   a. MinGW32/GNU C++ 3.x (wxDevCpp):
      Required Libraries to compile:
      1. wxWidgets-2.6.1 or higher with Unicode enabled
      2. Boost-1.33.0 or higher
      3. Boost.Xpressive latest version
      4. libunicows: it's optional under WinNT/XP, but required under Win98
   b. Visual C++ 7.1 (VS.Net 2003):
      Required Libraries to compile:
      1. wxWidgets-2.6.1 or higher with Unicode enabled
      2. Boost-1.33.0 or higher
      3. Boost.Xpressive latest version
      4. libunicows: it's optional under WinNT/XP, but required under Win98

P.S.: If you use CVS version of Boost, Boost.Xpressive has been included in the CVS HEAD, 
      or you must get 'xpressive.zip' at:
      http://www.boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?directory=Strings%20-%20Text%20Processing
P.S.2: Since MadEdit v0.2.2, Xpressive is attached in MadEdit sources package.

Syntax files, Locale files and Settings:
---------------------------------------
  Syntax files: in the path $(MadEditConfigPath)/syntax/
  Locale files: in the path $(MadEditConfigPath)/locale/
  
  $(MadEditConfigPath) are the one of below paths:
    1. MadEdit execution file directory : Windows and Linux
    2. $(HOME)/.madedit/ : Linux
    3. /usr/share/madedit/ : Linux
  
  If MadEdit does not find any files in those paths, 
  MadEdit can also execute standalone by using default settings.
  
  If you are under Win98, you must get unicows.dll from MS's website:
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=73BA7BD7-ED06-4F0D-80A4-2A7EEAEE17E2&displaylang=en
  
  When quit MadEdit, MadEdit will save the settings to:
    1. $(HOME)/.madedit/madedit.cfg: Linux
    2. $(MadEdit execution file directory)/MadEdit.cfg: Windows
  And FontWidth.dat will also be saved to the same path.
  FontWidth.dat is Cache of Font-Width-Data, it can speed-up MadEdit a lot.
